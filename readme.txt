#To run first use NPM Install

#This is small project of node here I have written the code of importing csv file to our mysql database.

#You can run this code and import your csv file to database and also can view the data. I have used server side processing for loading large data in very smooth way.

#NOTE: before running this code use need to increase upload_max_filesize = 10M (If it is less than 2MB that is by default in php.ini) because our csvdata.sql file is more than 2MB.

#Need to increase max_allowed_packet=10MB (in my.ini) this is by default 1MB and the file which is we are importing is more than 2MB
